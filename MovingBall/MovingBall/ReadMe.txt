The idea behind this project is to make a moving ball (hence the name "Moving Ball"). The ball should
be able to move freely around the screen, but being unable to leave the screen.
The user should be able to use a "boost"-function, where the ball moves faster - as long as there's
more "boost left in the fuel-tank". When the "fuel-tank" is empty, the ball shall again move slower.

After this, random ball spawn will be added, where the user can move over these balls, to "eat" them, and 
when this happens, the main ball shall get bigger.
