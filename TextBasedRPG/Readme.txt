Text Based RPG:
The idea is to make a mini-RPG, which is made from text only - which means no animations.
You start the game in a town (subject to change), where you can talk to people, learn new skills, buy stuff, or whatever the heart desires - and from here you can embark on adventures.
On the adventures you will have to make some choices, and be rewarded by the right ones, while being challenged by the wrong ones. After the adventure you will gain gold, expirience, and honor (the game is played in ~medieval times, so honor actually means something), which you can use to do various things in the town, before your next adventure.
